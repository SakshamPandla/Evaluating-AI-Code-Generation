-- ORIGINAL QUERY HAD MANY SYNTAX AND LOGICAL ERRORS:
-- 1. Mixed DML (UPDATE) with SELECT operations incorrectly
-- 2. Improper JOIN syntax and misused operators
-- 3. Invalid data types (strings for numeric values)
-- 4. Incorrect column references and invalid dates
-- 5. Improper ORDER BY and WHERE clause placement
-- 6. Syntax errors in comparison operators and keywords
-- 7. Invalid combination of clauses (ON DELETE CASCADE in a query)

-- CORRECTED QUERY:
UPDATE orders o
SET 
    o.quantity = 5,             -- Changed 'five' to numeric 5
    o.status = 'COMPLETED',     -- Added quotes for string value
    o.date_ordered = NOW()      -- Fixed column name spelling and added parentheses for function
FROM 
    orders o2                   -- Need to re-reference orders table for the join
    INNER JOIN customers c      -- Fixed JOIN type (can't mix LEFT and INNER)
        ON o2.customer_id = c.customer_id      -- Fixed join condition with proper operator
    INNER JOIN products p       -- Changed to proper join syntax
        ON c.customer_id = p.buyer_id          -- Fixed equality operator
    LEFT JOIN suppliers s       -- Added proper join with suppliers
        ON p.supplier_id = s.supplier_id       -- Fixed USING syntax to proper JOIN condition
WHERE 
    o.id = o2.id                -- Connect the main table to the FROM clause
    AND (p.name LIKE '%Laptop%'  -- Fixed CONTAIN to LIKE with wildcards
        OR c.email IS NULL)     -- Fixed NULL comparison syntax
    AND o.date_ordered BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-02-29'  -- Fixed invalid dates
GROUP BY 
    o.id                        -- Proper column reference for GROUP BY
HAVING 
    COUNT(*) >= 10              -- Changed 'ten' to numeric 10, fixed operator
ORDER BY 
    SUM(p.price) DESC           -- Fixed column name and sort direction
LIMIT 50 OFFSET 20;             -- Changed 'twenty' to numeric 20
