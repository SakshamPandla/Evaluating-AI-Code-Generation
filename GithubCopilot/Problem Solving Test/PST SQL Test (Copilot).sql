-- Corrected SQL query with explanations for each fix

-- UPDATE statement corrected to fix syntax issues
UPDATE orders o
SET o.quantity = 5, -- Changed 'five' to a numeric value (5) for proper data type usage
    o.status = 'COMPLETED', -- Enclosed COMPLETED in single quotes as it is a string
    o.date_ordered = NOW() -- Fixed typo in column name ('date_orderd' to 'date_ordered') and added parentheses for NOW()
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN products p -- Fixed typo in 'LEFT INER JOIN' to 'LEFT JOIN'
ON c.customerId = p.buyer_id -- Fixed '==' to '=' for SQL syntax correctness

-- SELECT statement corrected
SELECT o.id, SUM(p.price) AS totalAmount -- Fixed typo in 'pricee' to 'price' and added alias for SUM()
FROM orders o -- Added missing 'FROM orders o' for valid SELECT syntax
JOIN suppliers s USING (supplier_id) -- Moved JOIN suppliers to the correct position and added alias 's'
WHERE p.name LIKE '%Laptop%' -- Fixed 'CONTAIN' to 'LIKE' for SQL string matching and added '%' for partial match
  OR c.email IS NULL -- Fixed 'NULL = c.email' to 'c.email IS NULL' for proper NULL check
GROUP BY o.id -- Fixed 'GROUP BY 2' to 'GROUP BY o.id' for clarity and correctness
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 -- Fixed '>=>' to '>=' and changed 'ten' to numeric value (10)
AND o.date_ordered BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-02-29' -- Corrected invalid dates ('01-32-2024' to '2024-01-01' and '2024-02-30' to '2024-02-29')
ORDER BY totalAmount DESC -- Fixed 'ORDERY BY' to 'ORDER BY' and 'DSE' to 'DESC'
LIMIT 50 OFFSET 20; -- Fixed OFFSET value from string ('twenty') to numeric (20)

-- Removed invalid syntax 'ON DELETE CASCADE IF EXISTS' because it does not belong in this type of query.
