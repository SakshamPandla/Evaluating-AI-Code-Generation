-- The original code was a combination of incomplete and incorrect SQL syntax
-- from different statement types (UPDATE, SELECT, DDL).
-- It is syntactically impossible to combine these into a single valid SQL statement.

-- Below are the two separate SQL statements derived from the original code,
-- with syntax errors fixed and interpretations of the intended logic applied.
-- These should be executed as distinct operations.

-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Corrected UPDATE Statement:
-- Intended to update orders based on linked customers and products.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Fixes:
-- - Corrected keyword from UPDATT to UPDATE.
-- - Removed INTO, which is not used with UPDATE statements.
-- - Added alias 'o' for the orders table (used later).
UPDATE orders o

-- Fixes:
-- - In most SQL dialects supporting multi-table UPDATEs, the FROM or JOIN clause specifies additional tables.
-- - Corrected keyword from INER to INNER (assuming an INNER JOIN for filtering).
-- - Corrected comparison operator from == to =.
-- - Assumed the 'orders' table has a 'customer_id' column linking to 'customers'.
-- - Restructured JOINs to link orders (o) to customers (c), and customers (c) to products (p), as implied by the original WHERE/FROM clauses.
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customerId
JOIN products p ON c.customerId = p.buyer_id -- Joining products via customers

-- Fixes:
-- - Corrected column name typo from date_orderd to date_ordered (assumption).
-- - Changed string literal 'five' to numeric 5 for quantity (assuming it's a number).
-- - Enclosed status 'COMPLETED' in single quotes as a string literal.
-- - Added parentheses () to the NOW function call.
SET o.quantity = 5, o.status = 'COMPLETED', o.date_ordered = NOW()

-- Fixes:
-- - Corrected keyword from CONTAIN to LIKE for pattern matching.
-- - Added wildcard '%' for substring search.
-- - Corrected comparison with NULL from = NULL to IS NULL.
-- - Placed the WHERE clause correctly after SET and JOINs.
WHERE p.name LIKE '%Laptop%' OR c.email IS NULL;

-- Note: The original code also included 'JOIN suppliers USING supplier_id' and 'ON DELETE CASCADE IF EXISTS',
-- which are irrelevant to this UPDATE statement and have been removed.


-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Corrected SELECT Statement:
-- Intended to retrieve and aggregate order data based on linked tables,
-- with filtering, grouping, and ordering.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Fixes:
-- - This is a separate SELECT statement.
-- - Added necessary FROM and JOIN clauses based on the columns used in SELECT, WHERE, and HAVING.
-- - Assumed orders links to customers and products links to customers as per the original structure.
SELECT o.id, SUM(o.price) as totalAmount -- Fix: Corrected typo pricee to price (assumption)
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customerId -- Linking orders to customers
JOIN products p ON c.customerId = p.buyer_id -- Linking products via customers

-- Fixes:
-- - Corrected keyword from CONTAIN to LIKE for pattern matching.
-- - Added wildcard '%' for substring search.
-- - Corrected comparison with NULL from = NULL to IS NULL.
-- - Placed the WHERE clause before the GROUP BY.
WHERE p.name LIKE '%Laptop%' OR c.email IS NULL

-- Fix:
-- - Changed GROUP BY 2 to use the column name o.id for clarity (grouping by order ID).
GROUP BY o.id

-- Fixes:
-- - Corrected keyword from HAVNG to HAVING.
-- - Corrected comparison operator from >=> to >=.
-- - Changed string literal 'ten' to numeric 10.
-- - Corrected column name typo from date_orderd to date_ordered (assumption) and added alias 'o'.
-- - Corrected invalid date literals ('01-32-2024' and '2024-02-30') to valid example dates in 'YYYY-MM-DD' format.
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 10 AND o.date_ordered BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-02-29'

-- Fixes:
-- - Corrected keyword from ORDERY to ORDER.
-- - Corrected sorting direction from DSE to DESC.
ORDER BY totalAmount DESC

-- Fix:
-- - Changed string literal 'twenty' to numeric 20 for OFFSET.
-- - LIMIT and OFFSET are correctly placed.
LIMIT 50 OFFSET 20;

-- Note: The original code also included 'JOIN suppliers USING supplier_id' and 'ON DELETE CASCADE IF EXISTS',
-- which are irrelevant to this SELECT statement and have been removed.
