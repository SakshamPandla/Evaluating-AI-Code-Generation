#include <iostream> // Include the iostream library for input/output operations

// Fix 1: Corrected 'namspace' to 'namespace' and added a semicolon at the end.
using namespace std;

// Fix 2: Corrected the main function signature.
// The standard C++ main function is declared as int main().
int main() {
    // Fix 3: Corrected the variable declaration.
    // Added a semicolon at the end of the declaration line.
    // Corrected 'bike' to 'bikes' for consistency with later usage (though 'bike' would also work).
    int bikes, cars;

    // Fix 4: The original line 'cout << bikes << cars;' was attempting to print uninitialized variables.
    // Based on the calculation later, it seems the intention was to get input for bikes and cars.
    // Added prompts and input statements to read values from the user.
    cout << "Enter the number of bikes: ";
    // Use 'cin' to read input into the 'bikes' variable.
    cin >> bikes;

    cout << "Enter the number of cars: ";
    // Use 'cin' to read input into the 'cars' variable.
    cin >> cars;

    // Fix 5: Corrected the variable name 'totaltires' to 'totalTires' (using camelCase for better readability,
    // though the original name was syntactically okay if used consistently).
    // Fix 6: Corrected the calculation for car tires. Cars typically have 4 tires, not 2.
    int totalTires = bikes * 2 + cars * 4;

    // Fix 7: Corrected the output statement.
    // Changed 'cin' to 'cout' to print output to the console.
    // Corrected the output message string.
    // Fix 8: Corrected the variable name 'total_tiress' to 'totalTires' to match the calculated variable.
    // Added 'endl' to insert a newline character at the end of the output.
    cout << "Total tires: " << totalTires << endl;

    // Fix 9: Added a return statement.
    // The main function is declared to return an integer (int main()), so it should return a value.
    // Returning 0 indicates successful execution.
    return 0;
